 <p> Hello! My name is Llayton and welcome to my website. I am currently a senior attending James Campbell High School. During school, I enjoy keeping myself busy in a handful amount of extra-curricular activities. For example, I am involved in the Saber Judo team, Jazz Band, and also COR Club.<p/>
