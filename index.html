             <center><h3>Hello! My name is Llayton Ilar and welcome to my website!</h3></center>
       <center><p>I am currently a senior at James Campbell High School. I am involved in many extra curricular activities to keep myself busy everyday. For example, I am enrolled in COR Club, Saber Judo, and also Jazz Band. My favorite hobby primarily revolves around playing musical instruments. For example, I play guitar, trumpet, and also the piano. I believe that music is a reliable source of relaxation and a chance for me to express myself through notes and rhthyms. After highschool, my goals strictly involve obtaining my medical degree and enlisting in the United States Air Force. Although this island will always be my home, I dream about moving to the mainland after college. The experiences there are much broader and the possibilities are endless compared to this rock in the middle of the Pacific. </p> </center>
